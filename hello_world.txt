Hello World, it is I, the eater
Of worlds, of hearts, of hopes.
I am here to tell you something
No other reason.
All that is needed to be said
is that I am almost there
My hunger shall be sated
by the blood of pilgrims
the tears of orphans
and the souls of all humans
Blood will rain from the sky
and fill the streets
as my final form devours all
Goodbye.
